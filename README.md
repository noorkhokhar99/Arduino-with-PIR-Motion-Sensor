Introducing the PIR Motion Sensor


The PIR motion sensor is ideal to detect movement. PIR stand for “Passive Infrared”. Basically, the PIR motion sensor measures infrared light from objects in its field of view.

So, it can detect motion based on changes in infrared light in the environment. It is ideal to detect if a human has moved in or out of the sensor range.


Pinout
Wiring the PIR motion sensor to an Arduino is pretty straightforward – the sensor has only 3 pins.

GND – connect to ground
OUT – connect to an Arduino digital pin
5V – connect to 5V
